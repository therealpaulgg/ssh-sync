# Hosting packages.sshsync.io

This guide explains how to host the Debian and RPM repositories on your own Linux server.

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y nginx gnupg createrepo-c
   ```

2. **Create a directory for the repository**
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /srv/packages
   sudo chown $USER:$USER /srv/packages
   ```

3. **Place repository files**
   Copy the contents of the `repo` directory generated by the release workflow to `/srv/packages`.

4. **Serve over HTTPS**
   Configure your web server (e.g., Nginx) to serve `/srv/packages` at `packages.sshsync.io`. Use Let's Encrypt or another CA to obtain an SSL certificate.

5. **Publish your public key**
   Ensure `public.key` from the repository directory is available at the root so clients can import it:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://packages.sshsync.io/public.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/ssh-sync.gpg
   ```

After the server is configured, packages can be installed as documented in the README and docs site.
