MUST HAVES:
- data conflicts - how to resolve merging?
- currently it is possible to upload a duplicate ssh_configs entry where host, identity_file, etc. are the same. Probably need to figure this one out
- Allow users to delete certain keys or config entries
- allow users to obtain a list of their machines
- test delete code more
- add transactions
- if EOF is received, need to have nicer error message. Also cleanup better - what if part way thru setup and EOF happens?

Nice to haves:
- the live websocket code is scrappy, make it better
- Apparently you can have duplicate keys in a ssh config. Will have to not use a map[string]string and instead use a []keyValuePair or something.
- IdentityFile - due to this duplicate attribute issue, probably forget about storing it in its own column in the database and just ensure that the CLI parses it carefully
- add a space to each host entry in the ssh config generation
- this is a zero knowledge app, but maybe there are some things we should do to prevent the client from just sending whatever the hell it wants to the server?
