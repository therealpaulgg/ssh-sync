MUST HAVES:
- data conflicts - how to resolve merging?
- Allow users to delete certain keys or config entries
- test delete code more
- if EOF is received, need to have nicer error message. Also cleanup better - what if part way thru setup and EOF happens?
- server seems to sometimes panic when websocket connection gets closed in a strange way.

Nice to haves:
- Apparently you can have duplicate keys in a ssh config. Will have to not use a map[string]string and instead use a []keyValuePair or something.
- IdentityFile - due to this duplicate attribute issue, probably forget about storing it in its own column in the database and just ensure that the CLI parses it carefully
- add a space to each host entry in the ssh config generation
- this is a zero knowledge app, but maybe there are some things we should do to prevent the client from just sending whatever the hell it wants to the server?
